# IntPlanOpt
Integrated planning &amp; optimization tool

This tool provides a platform for integrated planning and optimization using optimization algorithms. 
Initially demonstrated with the example of meeting scheduling, 
the project's long-term goal is to advance into a comprehensive optimization system, 
operable across various domains and adaptable to the maximum likelihood principle.
